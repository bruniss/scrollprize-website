As of 12:00am Pacific, January 1st, 2024, the submission window for the Grand Prize has closed!

The technical and papyrological review teams are working through the received submissions, and we are excited to share results as soon as we can.

In 2023 we made history together by revealing, for the first time ever, hidden text from the inside of a rolled Herculaneum scroll.
The community that emerged around Vesuvius Challenge has been incredible, and we want to take this opportunity to say thank you.
We have accelerated progress on this amazing research problem, and we will read the scrolls!

Vesuvius Challenge is not over.
Along with Grand Prize results, we will soon announce the next stages.
For now, please stay engaged in our [community on Discord](https://discord.gg/V4fJhvtaQn), where discussion and exploration are ongoing.
The [datasets](data) will also remain available on our data server.

Happy New Year to all, and let's make 2024 as incredible as 2023!
